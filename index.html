    <p>Visual Studio is an app that you can use for the purpose of coding. It is very similar to another IDE, Brackets. There's JavaScript, HTML,
        CSS and many more. You can also live test it to see if it is working perfectly. It is very simple to install too.</p>
        <p>To access the code to the console, you just have to write console.log(whatever you want to access it). The console shows all th items
            you have coded. It is the most important screen. Without it you will not be able to see what you have written.
